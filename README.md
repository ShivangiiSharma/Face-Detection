# Face-Detection

This was made using the dlib library.

The pre-trained facial landmark detector inside the dlib library is used to estimate the location of 68 (x, y)-coordinates that map to facial structures on the face.

The Locations of the Facial Parts are as follows:

    The left eye is accessed with points (42, 47).
    The mouth is accessed through points (48, 67).
    The left eyebrow is accessed through points (22, 26).
    The nose is accessed using points (27, 34).
    The right eyebrow is accessed through points (17, 21).
    The right eye is accessed using points (36, 41).
    And the jaw is accessed via points (0, 16).

To close the ongoing frame readings, press 'Esc'.
